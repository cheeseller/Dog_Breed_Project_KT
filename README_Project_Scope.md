# Project information

This is a computational biology project for dog breed identification. It requires:

* Reading the "mystery.fa" sequence file containing an unknown dog's DNA.
* Comparing it against "dog_breeds.fa" sequence database  to find the closest sequence match.
* A virtual environment (venv) has been set up to store code and imported modules such as:

* Biopython - Bio.pairwise2 (for sequence alignment), Bio.Align (for handling multiple alignments), Bio.Phylo (for phylogenetic tree construction).
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn 

# Output and Goals

*Generate an output that states the closest matching breed and possibly other insights (e.g., alignment scores, phylogenetic relationships).

*Organizing the project into structured folders and version control (e.g., Git).
Documenting and testing the code, ensuring clarity, functionality, and correctness.

* Computing probabilities (e.g., similarity scores, p-values).
* Construct a phylogenetic tree from the sequences.


# Project Structure:
* A README_Project_Scope.md file providing project information
* A Python script to run the analysis.
* Separate folders for data, results, and code.

# Plan / Approach
* Read and Process FASTA Files (Ensure sequences are properly stored)
* Align the Mystery Dog Sequence to the Database
* Determine the Closest Matching Breed
* Improve Accuracy (Scoring Matrices)
* Output and Save the Results
* Visualization and Phylogenetic Tree
